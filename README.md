Hi , I have developed a module in Angular JS based on specification sheet designed in abode photoshop. Used $http to retrieve data from JSON call and view it on webpage. Display all the restuarant list along with its addresses and yelp rating page on hover and clicking on image.

I have used CDN for angular js and have also used font-awesome for icons.
But If your doing a complete project unlike mine I would highly recommend you to get started with angular-seed or yeoman-angular project.
